# Project 3 Prep

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:Room has a width of at least 2 tiles, while a hallway only has 1 or 2 tile. They are similar in that they both have a width and a height.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of 
drawing a knight world and randomly generating a world 
using rooms and hallways?**

Answer: The analogy should be we find the pattern first. Then we use the pattern to generate a random world. And then we check if the room and hallway are valid.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually 
get to the full knight world.**

Answer: I would think of writing a method that would generate a random world with rooms and hallways.

**This question is open-ended. Write some classes 
and methods that might be useful for Project 3. Think 
about what helper methods and classes you used for the lab!**

Answer: I would make a class called WorldGenerator. I would make a method called generateWorld that would generate a random world with rooms and hallways.
I would make a method that checks the validation of the room and hallway.
